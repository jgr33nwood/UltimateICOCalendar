# Ultimate ICO Calendar - Forked from https://github.com/Scanate/UltimateICOCalendar to maintain regular updates.

There are a lot of ICO calendars with incomplete information. So, why not crowdsource it and allow people (including founders) to contribute?

The ICOs listed here are either upcoming or currently ongoing.

If you would like to contribute, submit a pull request with the information you would like added.

If you have any random suggestions (like adding a column), feel free to post an Issue.
